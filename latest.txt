Student Exploration: Density

Directions: Follow the instructions to go through the simulation. Respond to the questions and prompts in the orange boxes.

Vocabulary: density, mass, matter, volume

Prior Knowledge Questions (Do these BEFORE using the Gizmo.)

List three objects that you think would sink in water, and three objects you think would float.

Sink:
Gold nugget, rock
Float:
Ball , Golf ball, Crown 2


Why do you think some things float and some things sink?

Some float and others sink because of the object's density.


Gizmo Warm-up

In the Gizmo, drag the apple onto the Scale. The scale measures mass. Mass is the amount of matter, or “stuff,” in an object.

What is the apple’s mass? (Note: “g” stands for grams.)
33.0 G


An object’s volume is the amount of space it takes up. The volume of an object can be measured by using a graduated cylinder. Observe the graduated cylinder and the blue text showing the volume of water inside the cylinder.
What is the starting volume of water in the graduated cylinder?
400.0 ML
Place the apple into the cylinder. What is the volume in the cylinder now?
444.0 ML


The water rises in the cylinder because it is displaced, or pushed upward, by the apple. The amount of displaced water is equal to the volume of the apple.
What is the volume of the apple? (Use the Object volume to check.)
44.0 CM


Note: Milliliters (mL) are used for liquid volumes, while cubic centimeters (cm3) are used for solids. One mL is the same volume as one cm3. The apple’s volume is measured in cm3.






Activity A:
Sink or float?
Get the Gizmo ready:
Replace all objects on the shelf.
Be sure the liquid in the beaker is Water.




Question: How do mass and volume affect sinking and floating?

Predict: Which objects do you think will float in water? Which do you think will sink? Record your predictions below in the first column of the table.

Experiment: Use the Gizmo to find the mass and volume of each object and whether it floats or sinks. Record your results in the table.

Analyze results: Look at the data in your table.

Can you use mass alone to predict whether an object will sink or float? Explain.

You can’t because you need mass AND volume to predict it

SIn
Can you use volume alone to predict whether an object will sink or float? Explain.

You can’t because you need mass AND volume to predict it


Draw conclusion: Can you use mass and volume to predict whether an object will sink or float in water? Explain your thinking.

Yes because things with a lot of mass will obviously sink but things with low mass have a higher chance of floating. you also can because volume tells you if the object floats or not.


Apply: Measure the mass and volume of the toy soldier. 

Mass:
120.0
Volume:
80.0


Will it float or sink?
Sink
Use the Gizmo to test your prediction. 








Activity B:
Calculating density
Get the Gizmo ready:
Replace the objects on the shelves.
Be sure the liquid in the beaker is Water.




Question: How does density tell you whether an object will sink or float?

Calculate: Density is the amount of mass contained in a given volume. To find the density of an object, divide its mass by its volume. Density is recorded in units of grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). 

What is the density of an object with a mass of 100 g and a volume of 50 cm3?

2


Record data: In the Gizmo, find mass and volume of the objects listed below. Then calculate each object’s density and record it. Finally, test whether each one sinks or floats in water.

Draw conclusion: The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, or 1.0 g/cm3. Look at the data in your table. How can you use the density of an object to predict whether it will sink or float?

The higher the density the higher the chance it sinks.


Apply: In the Gizmo, either Crown 1 or Crown 2 is solid gold (but not both). Find the density of the gold nugget and of each crown. (Hint: You will probably need a calculator to do this.)


Density of the gold nugget:
19.3
Density of Crown 1:
8.4
Density of Crown 2:
19.3
Which crown is pure gold?
Crown 2








Activity C: 
Egg-speriment
Get the Gizmo ready:
Replace all the objects on the shelf.




Question: How does an object behave in different liquids?

Observe:  Use the Gizmo to explore whether the egg sinks or floats in different liquids. Record what you find in the table below. 

Liquid
Water
Oil
Gasoline
Seawater
Corn Syrup
Sink or Float?
Sink

Float


Draw conclusion: Which liquids are denser than the egg? Which are less dense? Explain your reasoning.

The denser ones are the ones that make the egg float and the less denser liquids have the egg sink


Extend your thinking: Observe the egg in each liquid again.

In which liquid does the egg float the highest? 
Corn Syrup
In which liquid does the egg sink the fastest?
Gasoline
Which liquid do you think is the densest? Least dense? Explain.
The corn syrup



Challenge yourself: Using the objects in the Gizmo to help you, list the liquids from densest to least dense. Discuss your answer with your teacher and classmates. (Hint: Compare where objects float within each liquid.)

  
Water, Oil, Gasoline, Seawater,Corn syrup.
